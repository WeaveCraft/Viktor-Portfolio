        learningJourney="During my educational journey, I recognized the significance of Git as a version control system and began using it. 
        However, it was during my second internship at LearningWell, where I collaborated with a small team of four individuals, that I truly delved into the intricacies of Git and its role in effective version control.
        Working alongside experienced professionals, I gained a deeper understanding of Git's capabilities and its impact on collaborative software development.
        Through hands-on experience, I became proficient in utilizing Git for branching, merging, and resolving conflicts, enabling seamless collaboration within our team."
